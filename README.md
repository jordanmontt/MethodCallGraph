# Method Call Graph

Thread-aware method-level call graph built using `MethodProxies` as the instrumentation backend. Calls from different threads are tracked separately.

All methods in the target application are instrumented. The tool records:

- Call frequency (number of times each method is invoked)
- Callerâ€“callee relationships (who called who)
- Thread context (calls from other threads are identified and separated)

Each invocation updates the graph in real time. The final graph captures method interactions and execution counts across threads.

# Method Call Graph

Thread-aware method-level call graph built using `MethodProxies` as the instrumentation backend. Calls from different threads are tracked separately.

All methods in the target application are instrumented. The tool records:

- Call frequency (number of times each method is invoked)
- Callerâ€“callee relationships (who called who)
- Thread context (calls from other threads are identified and separated)

Each invocation updates the graph in real time. The final graph captures method interactions and execution counts across threads.

## How to install

```st
EpMonitor disableDuring: [
	Metacello new
		baseline: 'MethodCallGraph';
		repository: 'github://jordanmontt/MethodCallGraph:main';
		load ].
```

## Usage

```st
callGraphProfiler := MethodCallGraphProfiler new.
callGraphProfiler packageNamesToInstrument:  { 'Microdown' . 'Microdown-RichTextComposer' }. "Set target packages to instrument"
callGraphProfiler profileOn: [ "Your application code here" ]
```
